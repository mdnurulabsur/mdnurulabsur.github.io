## Summary

My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Systems, advancing Edge Intelligence for XR, 3D reconstruction, and multimodal sensing. I design frameworks that combine vision, depth, wireless, and inertial data with system-level components such as WiFi, MEC, SDN, and O-RAN to achieve low-latency, privacy-preserving, and disruption-resilient performance. The broader goal of my work is to enable trustworthy, scalable, and real-time intelligence for healthcare, disaster response, and next-generation immersive environments.
