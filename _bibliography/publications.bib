abstract="Data science has become a hot buzzword in the current world. Analysis of big data with the help of shallow and deep learning methodologies has been increased in computer science, education, business technologies, medical science, manufacturing engineering, CRM, bioinformatics, statistics, etc. It has excellent potential to develop the healthcare system. Various multi-dimensional data sets, data visualization techniques, machine learning, and different data mining approaches are used extensively by scientists to predict patients' conditions and reduce the cost of ensuring that the patients get appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right place. Implementing different shallow and deep learning approaches to the medical field reduces medical errors and ensures patient's reliability and safety. Besides, if these methodologies can be helpful ineffective treatment, which may reduce the cost of unwanted medical tests, medication errors can also be kept at a tolerable level, and medical errors can be reduced. In this paper, the effective use of shallow and deep learning and their performances in various circumstances is portrayed with relevant results. Practical usage of machine learning algorithms will pave the way to produce better work in medical science and sublime the treatment procedure in terms of effectiveness.",

ABSTRACT = {Uneven roads pose significant challenges to vehicle stability, passenger comfort, and safety, especially in snowy and mountainous regions. These problems are often complex and challenging to resolve with traditional detection and stabilization methods. This paper presents a dual-method approach to improving vehicle stability by identifying road irregularities and dynamically adjusting the balance. The proposed solution combines YOLOv8 for real-time road anomaly detection with a GY-521 sensor to track the speed of servo motors, facilitating immediate stabilization. YOLOv8 achieves a peak precision of 0.99 at a confidence threshold of 1.0 rate in surface recognition, surpassing conventional sensor-based detection. The vehicle design is divided into two sections: an upper passenger seating area and a lower section that contains the engine and wheels. The GY-521 sensor is strategically placed to monitor road conditions, while the servomotor stabilizes the upper section, ensuring passenger comfort and reducing the risk of accidents. This setup maintains stability even on uneven terrain. Furthermore, the proposed solution significantly reduces collision risk, vehicle wear, and maintenance costs while improving operational efficiency. Its compatibility with various vehicles and capabilities makes it an excellent candidate for enhancing road safety and driving experience in challenging environments. In addition, this work marks a crucial step towards a safer, more sustainable, and more comfortable transportation system.},

abstract = {Visual—Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose. However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead to server-side threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities. Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense baseline.},

ABSTRACT={Dengue remains a significant and critical global health concern, especially in resource-constrained and remote regions, where traditional IgG/IgM-based testing is often delayed or not conducted properly. Furthermore, conventional machine learning often exhibits minimal interpretability and misclassification, leading to major unreliability in real-time clinical decisions. To tackle these hindrances, we proposed an interpretable, efficient, and novel machine learning framework that operates near real-time. It combines feature optimization using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to address data imbalance, and enhances ubiquitous decision interpretability with Explainable AI (XAI). GA establishes the most predictive hematological features, which improve accuracy and transparency, whereas GAN-based data generation handles class imbalance, leading to enhanced generalization. On top of that, the optimized Decision Tree model attains 99.49% accuracy with a negligible computational cost of training and testing time 0.0025 s, and 0.0013 s respectively, superseding the current state-of-the-art. A web-based application implemented based on the proposed model enables real-time risk prediction with a latency of under 0.6 s. A comprehensive XAI evaluation using LIME, SHAP, Morris sensitivity analysis, permutation combination, and RFE consistently identifies WBC and platelet counts as key predictors. In numbers, XAI techniques represent that low White Blood Cell (WBC) count (< 3,700 cells/μL), platelet count (< 136,000 cells/μL), and Platelet Distribution Width (PDW < 23) are key indicators of dengue. Our proposed integrated GA-GAN-XAI framework bridges accuracy, interpretability, and real-time decision-making capability. This approach is highly accurate, robust for healthcare, and a highly deployable solution for dengue risk prediction for clinical dengue risk assessment.}}
